README

Rep_01 and Rep_02 are 2 unique experiments. Please edit Rep_01 masks first.

03_masked contains unedited masks and original images. Do not alter these,
but if you lose images from 04_maskEdits you can copy from 03_masked to replace them.
04_maskEdits is where you need to edit the leaf and lesion masks to:
- make each leaf segment or lesion a solid white shape
- remove any other white shapes on the black background
- separate leaf segments and lesions by at least a 3-pixel line
